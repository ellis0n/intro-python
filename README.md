Projects for Intro to Python

My name is Glen May.
I live in St. John's, Newfoundland with my partner. Together, we play in a band called CONDITIONER. (https://ccconditionerrr.bandcamp.com/). We have three cats and a baby on the way.
I'm currently enrolled in a Software Development program at Keyin College.
This repo contains some of the projects tackled in my Intro to Python course.
